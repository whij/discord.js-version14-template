Thanks Whittle for ordering me again! You might be familiar with this
type of file structure I have going on with the previous rust bot order.

Since then I have reconsidered my pricing plans and am offering more for
less! I'll be helping you with your learning journey for a month!
Time starts the moment the order is considered delivered.

To get started, download Node.js 16.9.0 or newer. Open a
terminal/command prompt to this folder and type "npm install". This
installs all the packages required for the bot to work.

Make sure that .env is filled out with your bot token and application ID
which can be found in the discord developer dashboard.

Commands are set to be deployed globally by default, since you are
learning to create your own commands, I'd highly recommend you to change
it to require deploy-guild in the ready event. Provided that there is a
guild ID in .env.

This bot comes with Discord Hybrid Sharding which is a highly optimized
version of the normal sharding discord.js comes with. It creates clusters
where 2 shards share 1 shard's performance. Documentation can be found here:

Thank you for choosing me, If you have any questions you can contact me
over at Discord!
